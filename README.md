## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Built with

-   HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

What I learned is that I need to think out my mark up better. Ran into obstacles with the way I set it up, but did not feel like refactoring the code. I also think CSS Grid would have been better for some of the layout.

### Useful resources
